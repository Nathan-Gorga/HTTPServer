Trying to build an HTTP server from scratch to understand how they work

I'm going to use libraries like sockets.h

I might start a project in the future where I try to go as low level as possible, remove as much abstractions as possible and build my own sockets that integrate directly with the OS

for now, I will use the libs

In a second part, I wish to attach the built server, break it and fix it to also understand web security and red team blue team mechanics

Wish me luck :)
